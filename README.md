# Jatra
An application designed to make bus commuting easier and efficient by providing the names of all the available buses that travel from the user’s current location to their chosen destination and tracking them in real time

# Purpose
  1. There are countless number of busses having their own unique routes. It often becomes bothersome to remember these routes 
  2. Often we are in rush for work and prefer other costly commuting services as we are unsure of when the bus is going to arrive
  3. In Bangladesh, majority of the local busses are in poor condition and thus falls prey to bad passenger service and therefore              motivates them to skip busses as their daily commute
  
# How does it help?
  1. It lets you search the bus routes of all the busses that passes along your nearest bus stops to your preferred destination
  2. It uses a GPS tracking system to show you the real time location of the busses. As a result, you don’t have to wait for an                unknown amount of time and instead jump into a different transport if the bus is too far away or wait for a short period and              enjoy your ride with almost 1/5thof the cost
  3. Users are able to rate and review the busses to help the community
